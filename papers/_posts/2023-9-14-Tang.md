# Abstract
Folic acid and its derivatives are required for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and some amino acids. Antifolate antibiotics that target the folic acid metabolism pathway are commonly used for the treatment of listeriosis caused by the intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes (Lm). In recent work in mBio, Feng et al. sought to understand the role of folic acid metabolism in Lm virulence (Y. Feng, S. Chang, D. A. Portnoy, 2023, mBio https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.01074-23). The authors discovered that N-formylmethionine, an amino acid utilized by bacteria to initiate protein synthesis, is crucial for Lm intracellular growth and pathogenesis. Surprisingly, purines and thymidine were found to be dispensable for Lm infection. Together these results demonstrate that while Lm can obtain many essential nutrients from the host cytosol, including purines and most amino acids, it requires N-formylmethionine biosynthesis to properly regulate translation initiation during infection.
