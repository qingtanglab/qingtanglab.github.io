# Abstract

Canalization involves mutational robustness, the lack of phenotypic change as a result of
genetic mutations. Given the large divergence in phenotype across species, understanding
the relationship between high robustness and evolvability has been of interest to both the
orists and experimentalists. Although canalization was originally proposed in the context
of multicellular organisms, the effect of multicellularity and other classes of hierarchical or
ganization on evolvability has not been considered by theoreticians. We address this issue
using a Boolean population model with explicit representation of an environment in which
individuals with explicit genotype and a hierarchical phenotype representing multicellularity
evolve. Robustness is described by a single real number between zero and one which emerges
from the genotype-phenotype map. We find that high robustness is favored in constant
environments, and lower robustness is favored after environmental change. Multicellularity
and hierarchical organization severely constrain robustness: peak evolvability occurs at an
absolute level of robustness of about 0.99 compared with values of about 0.5 in a classical
neutral network model. These constraints result in a sharp peak of evolvability in which the
maximum is set by the fact that the fixation of adaptive mutations becomes more improbable
 as robustness decreases. When robustness is put under genetic control, robustness levels
leading to maximum evolvability are selected for, but maximal relative fitness appears to
require recombination.
