# Abstract
The gut microbiome is a complex and dynamic ecosystem that profoundly influences host physiology, playing an important role in regulating development and maintaining homeostasis throughout the human lifespan. This chapter examines the interactions between the gut microbiome and host systems, focusing on its influence on the development of the nervous and immune system, as well as the underlying mechanisms driving these effects. Through various molecular and cellular mechanisms, such as the production of microbial metabolites and modulation of host signaling pathways, the gut microbiome regulates various critical aspects of immune and nervous system development and functions. Furthermore, this chapter discusses recent findings on the implication of the gut microbiome dysbiosis in different neurodevelopmental disorders and immune-related diseases. Advances in microbiome research methodologies, including gnotobiotic models, high-throughput sequencing, and metabolomics, have enabled deeper insights into these complicated interrelations. By integrating these findings, this chapter offers a comprehensive overview of the pivotal role of the gut microbiome in host development, particularly in nervous and immune systems, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for improving human health in the future.
