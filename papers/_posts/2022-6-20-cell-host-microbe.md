# Abstract

Antimicrobials can impact bacterial physiology and host immunity with negative treatment outcomes. Extensive exposure to antifolate antibiotics promotes thymidine-dependent Staphylococcus aureus small colony variants (TD-SCVs), commonly associated with worse clinical outcomes. We show that antibiotic-mediated disruption of thymidine synthesis promotes elevated levels of the bacterial second messenger cyclic di-AMP (c-di-AMP), consequently inducing host STING activation and inflammation. An initial antibiotic screen in Firmicutes revealed that c-di-AMP production was largely driven by antifolate antibiotics targeting dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), which promotes folate regeneration required for thymidine biosynthesis. Additionally, TD-SCVs exhibited excessive c-di-AMP production and STING activation in a thymidine-dependent manner. Murine lung infection with TD-SCVs revealed STING-dependent elevation of proinflammatory cytokines, causing higher airway neutrophil infiltration and activation compared with normal-colony S. aureus and hemin-dependent SCVs. Collectively, our results suggest that thymidine metabolism disruption in Firmicutes leads to elevated c-di-AMP-mediated STING-dependent inflammation, with potential impacts on antibiotic usage and infection outcomes.
