title: Develop a mechanistic-inspired model to explore how natural mutator alleles could affect phenotypic evolution.

Ultimately, mutations may affect phenotypes and fitness. Although there is extensive theoretical modeling of the evolutionary process of mutator alleles, these models are not based on real data and have simplified assumptions. For example, population genetic models usually ignore the entire developmental process, which can miss important constraints. My goal is to connect the discovery of mutator alleles from experiments and data analysis to construct a realistic model of phenotypic evolution which incorporates mutation rate and spectra variation, as well as a phenotype of interest. I will utilize existing data from deep mutational scan experiments to capture the genotype to phenotype map, and then develop a model capturing the effects of mutator alleles in order to predict the effect of mutators on phenotypic evolution.
