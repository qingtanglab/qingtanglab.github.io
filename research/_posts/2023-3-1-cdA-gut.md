Many studies have shown that antibiotic treatment reduces microbiota species diversity, potentially leading to antibiotic-associated gastrointestinal inflammation or pathogen infections. However, the impact of sub-inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics on microbiota physiology and host immune homeostasis remains largely unknown. The dominant gut microbial phyla in humans are Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria. These phyla produce c-di-AMP, which activates STING and influences gut homeostasis and immune responses to commensals and pathogens. In a recent study by [Tang et al. (2022)], bacteria treated with antifolate, penicillin G, and novobiocin exhibited increased c-di-AMP levels, suggesting that different categories of antibiotics may affect gut immune responses by modifying STING signaling. Appropriate STING activation maintains intestinal homeostasis, whereas excessive gut STING signaling contributes to tissue damage and disease progression. The Tang lab aims to investigate how antibiotics impact intestinal immune homeostasis and the development of inflammatory bowel disease by altering the microbiota's physiological processes.
