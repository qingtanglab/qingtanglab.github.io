Numerous studies have demonstrated that antibiotic treatment decreases the diversity of microbiota species, potentially leading to gastrointestinal inflammation or susceptibility to pathogen infections. However, the effects of sub-inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics on microbiota physiology and host immune homeostasis remain largely unexplored. The Tang lab is dedicated to investigating how antibiotics impact intestinal immune homeostasis and the development of inflammatory bowel disease by altering the microbiotaâ€™s physiological processes. Specifically, we are focusing on the role of c-di-AMP, produced by dominant phyla in the human gut microbiota such as Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria, which activates the STING pathway. The Tang lab is actively characterizing this novel aspect of antibiotic treatment and its influence on mucosal immunity through c-di-AMP signaling.
