Methicillin-Resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA) infections result in significant mortality around the world. The Tang Lab focuses on investigating the pathogenesis of <i>S. aureus</i> through murine lung infection and systemic infection models. Our research involves utilizing Tn-seq to identify cell factors that are essential for the survival of <i>S. aureus</i> in both macrophages and mice.
