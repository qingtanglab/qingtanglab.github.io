Cancer immunotherapy is a strategy that manipulates and harnesses the host immune system for the treatment of cancer. Although immunotherapies have demonstrated long-lasting clinical responses, their effectiveness can vary among different subsets of cancer patients. Consequently, innovative immunotherapy approaches with broader applicability are warranted. One promising avenue involves the administration of cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs), which has exhibited impressive anti-tumor efficacy in preclinical studies. The Tang lab is dedicated to understanding the interactions between tumors and microbes within the tumor microenvironment and developing bacterial delivery vehicles for intratumoral delivery of CDNs.
