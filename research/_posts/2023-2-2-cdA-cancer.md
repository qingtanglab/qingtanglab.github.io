Cancer immunotherapy modulates and leverages the host immune system to treat cancer. While different immunotherapy approaches, including T-cell therapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors, have obtained durable clinical responses, their efficacy varies in different subsets of cancer patients. Therefore, innovative immunotherapy approaches with broader applicability are warranted. Intratumoral injection of cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) has shown remarkable anti-tumor efficacy in preclinical studies and is under investigation in human clinical trials. However, their hydrophilic nature and susceptibility to degradation by extracellular CDN phosphodiesterases hinder their efficiency in penetrating the solid tumor. Novel synthetic STING agonists are being designed to prevent degradation, but they may also have high toxicity. To overcome this, bacteria delivery vehicles are being used to deliver STING agonists directly to tumors. The Tang aims to understand tumor-microbe interactions in the tumor microenvironment and develop novel cancer immunotherapies leveraging Listeria monocytogenes![image](https://github.com/qingtanglab/qingtanglab.github.io/assets/133623082/ecaf1653-bcd2-43e5-ba7e-3cf1e9b26412)
