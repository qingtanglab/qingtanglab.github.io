Cyclic dimeric adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (c-di-AMP) is a second messenger conserved in a wide variety of bacteria and archaea. It regulates various prokaryotic functions such as metabolism, osmotic pressure, cell integrity, and antibiotic susceptibility. C-di-AMP also serves as a conserved microbial signature for innate immune detection of several bacterial pathogens. During infection, bacterial pathogens produce c-di-AMP, which binds to and activates Stimulator of interferon genes (STING). While c-di-AMP plays a crucial role in regulating bacterial physiology and the host's innate immune response, many details of the c-di-AMP signaling network remain unknown. A recent study by [Tang et al. (2022)] discovered that bacterial stress caused by antibiotics increases c-di-AMP that directly stimulates host inflammation. The Tang lab is interested in (i) characterizing the precise mechanism by which antibiotic treatment modulates the host immune response through c-di-AMP and (ii) elucidating the role of c-di-AMP in regulating bacterial viability and pathogenesis under antibiotic stress.
