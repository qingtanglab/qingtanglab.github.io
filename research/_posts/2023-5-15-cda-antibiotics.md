Cyclic dimeric adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (c-di-AMP) acts as a global regulator for various prokaryotic physiological processes and a conserved microbial signature for innate immune detection of several bacterial pathogens. A recent study by Tang et al. (2022) discovered that bacterial stress caused by antibiotics increases c-di-AMP that directly stimulates host inflammation by activating Stimulator of interferon genes (STING). The Tang lab is interested in (i) characterizing the precise mechanism by which antibiotic treatment modulates the host immune response through c-di-AMP; (ii) elucidating the role of c-di-AMP in regulating bacterial viability and pathogenesis under antibiotic stress.
