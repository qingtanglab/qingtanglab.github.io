Cyclic dimeric adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (c-di-AMP) acts as a global regulator for various prokaryotic physiological processes and serves as a conserved microbial signature for innate immune detection of several bacterial pathogens. A recent study by [Tang et al. (2022)] discovered that bacterial stress caused by antibiotics increases c-di-AMP, which directly stimulates host inflammation by activating the Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING). The Tang Lab is interested in (i) characterizing the precise mechanism by which antibiotic treatment modulates the host immune response through c-di-AMP and (ii) elucidating the role of c-di-AMP in regulating the viability and pathogenesis of <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i> under antibiotic stress.
