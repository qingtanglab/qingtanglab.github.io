S. aureus Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections result in significant mortality around the world. The Tang Lab focuses on investigating the pathogenesis of S. aureus through murine lung infection and systemic infection models. Our research involves the utilization of Tn-seq to cell factors that are essential for the survival of S. aureus in both macrophages and mice.
