Methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA) poses a serious public health threat due to its drug resistance. Characterizing metabolic pathways in MRSA may provide new insights into targeting these essential processes, potentially leading to novel strategies for controlling MRSA infections. Pearl Perl uses techniques such as DRaCALA and EMSA to characterize the DNA-binding ability of GlnR in the presence of different regulatory proteins. In collaboration with Josh Leeming, Perl has found that the signaling protein PstA regulates the transcription factor GlnR, which in turn controls glutamine metabolism in MRSA.
