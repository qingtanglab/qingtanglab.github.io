The second messenger c-di-AMP is essential for aerobic growth in <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>; however, many aspects of the c-di-AMP signaling network in <i>S. aureus</i> remain to be elucidated. Josh’s research focuses on uncovering the regulatory role of c-di-AMP in glutamine metabolism, a process crucial for bacterial growth. He has identified a novel regulator, PstA, a PII family protein that modulates the transcription of glutamine synthesis genes. These findings reveal a previously unknown aspect of the nitrogen regulatory circuitry in <i>S. aureus</i>.
