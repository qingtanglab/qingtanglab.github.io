Minh is an undergraduate LSAMP scholar in 2024 who spent the summer working with the Tang Lab. During her time with us, she focused on identifying Staphylococcus aureus genes essential for systemic infection in mice and made remarkable progress in just two months. Minh, you will be greatly missed by all of us.
