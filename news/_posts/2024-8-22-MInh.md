Minh is an undergraduate LSAMP scholar in 2024 who spent the summer working with the Tang Lab. During her time with us, she focused on identifying <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> genes essential for systemic infection in mice and made remarkable progress in just two months. Minh, you will be greatly missed by all of us.
