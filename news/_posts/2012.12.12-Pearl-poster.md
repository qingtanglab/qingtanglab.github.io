Methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA) poses a serious public health threat due to its drug resistance. Characterizing glutamine metabolism may provide new insights into targeting this essential metabolic pathway, potentially leading to novel strategies for controlling MRSA infections. Pearl is investigating how the signaling protein PstA regulates the transcription factor GlnR, which in turn controls glutamine metabolism in MRSA.
