### Jiang lab will officially start in Janurary of 2024.  The lab is actively looking for new graduate students/postdocs, and a lab manager. We will also take undergraduate students either to assist lab management or participate research projects. Please reach out to Pengyao Jiang (pyjiang2@gmail.com)  to discuss the opportunities. 


Our lab sits at the intersection of genetics, genomics, evolutionary biology, molecular biology,  and computational biology. We welcome enthusiastic students at different levels of experience, of either experimental or quantitative backgrounds.  Applicants of diverse backgrounds are particularly encouraged to apply. __Note that only inquiries with all the required documents sent will be considered.__



## Graduate students

Graduate students from different programs of [School of Life Sciences] at ASU (e.g. [Evolutionary Biology Program], [Molecular/Cellular Biology Program], [Biology Program]) can join the group. Perspective graduate students, students (including master students) from other departments  and rotation students  are welcome to reach out. Please send (1) a current CV and (2) your research interest or ideas of what you want to work on in my lab via email. 


## Postdoctoral fellows

Please send (1) cover letter (in email is fine) that includes the names and contacts for three references and a short statement of your research interests with the relavance to research themes in my lab, (2) a current CV via email. 

## Lab manager 

Please send (1) current resume or CV via email. Please include any former lab experience. 

## Undergraduate students

I will take some curious undergraduate students from ASU to participate in my research. Students should have taken either basic biology/genetics course or have taken a programming/mathematical course. Please send (1) current resume or CV via email, (2) your research interest and what you want to learn in my lab and (3) your short-term/long-term goal. We will also need student helpers, and we will start recruiting after the hiring of a lab manager.
