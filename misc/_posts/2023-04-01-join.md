### Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
The Tang Lab is committed to promoting diversity, equality, and inclusion in the lab, department, school, and broader community. We are creating an environment in which everyone feels welcomed, respected, valued, and intellectually-stimulated. Tang Lab will actively work to help underrepresented populations achieve leadership roles and success in science.

## Graduate students

The Tang lab accepts rotation graduate students from [Quantitative Biology-Ph.D. program] for the September cohorts (2024) and Spring cohorts (2025).

## Undergraduate students

Undergraduate students are encouraged to apply, either to assist with lab management or to participate in research projects. [Federal Work-Study program (FWS)], [Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program (UROP)] and [Undergraduate Research Assistant Program (UGRAP)] awardees will be given preference. Please contact Qing Tang at qing.tang@uta.edu to discuss potential opportunities.
