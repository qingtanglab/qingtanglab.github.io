### Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
The Tang lab is committed to promoting diversity, equality, and inclusion in the lab, department, school, and broader community. We are creating an environment in which everyone feels welcomed, respected, valued, and intellectually-stimulated. Tang lab will actively work to help underrepresented populations achieve leadership roles and success in science.

### Please join us!
The Tang lab will officially start in January 2024. Rotation students are welcome to join for the spring semester, and the lab is actively seeking postdoctoral researchers and a lab manager. Undergraduate students are also encouraged to apply, either to assist with lab management or participate in research projects. Interested individuals can send their resumes to Qing Tang at tangqinguw@gmail.com to discuss potential opportunities.
