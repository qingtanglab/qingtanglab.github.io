About this site
This website is adapted from an excellent open-source template from the Trevor Bedford's wesbite [bedford.io](http://bedford.io). It also borrows some layouts from [Pengyao Jiang's Lab]. You are welcome to use or repupose my codes to build your own website, but if you do, I’d highly appreciate attribution and a link back here in your ‘about’ page. The source code is available in this [Github repository]. Instructions on how to update the content of the site and make other changed can be found in the file README.md.
