This site is derived and modified from the clean and minimalist design from Trevor Bedford's wesbite [bedford.io](http://bedford.io). The site is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/). It also borrows some layouts from [Alan Drummond Lab](http://drummondlab.org) and [Navish Wadhwa Lab](https://wadhwalab.com/). 


This site is hosted on the github pages, and the [source](https://github.com/pyjiang/pyjiang.github.io) is freely available. You're welcome to repurpose the source code for your site, but I would very much appreciate attribution and a link back to this site. 

Instructions on how to build the site and add contents, please check out the `README.md` file in the Github [repo](https://github.com/pyjiang/pyjiang.github.io). 

Adding contents to the site involves just simply adding a [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) file to the corresponding repository. 

Color palette is from [Happy Hues](https://www.happyhues.co/palettes/11).

Free icons used at this site are downloaded from [flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/) (from author [Eucalyp](https://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/experiment_1643812).).
