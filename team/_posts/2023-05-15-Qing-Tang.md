Qing joined the University of Texas at Arlington as an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Biology] in January 2024. 

From 2018 to 2023, Qing work in [Dr. Joshua J. Woodward]'s lab as a postdoctoral scholar in the Department of Microbiology at the University of Washington. Following that, she held the position of Acting Instructor from 2023 to 2024 in the same department. 

Qing earned her Ph.D. in the Department of Life Science and Technology at Huazhong Agricultural University, where she studied under the supervision of [Dr. Jin He] from 2011 to 2017.
