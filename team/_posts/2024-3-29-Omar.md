My name is Omar Elkassih, and I'm a senior majoring in Microbiology. Currently, I'm working on a project investigating proteins potentially implicated in Methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> intracellular survival. My goal is to continue my education in an MD-PhD program and work in the field of immunology/microbiology.
