Hello my name is Oscar, and I’m originally from México. I have obtained my bachelor’s in Biology with a minor in Biochemistry, and now I’m pursuing a PhD in Quantitative Biology under Dr. Qing Tang. My research within the Tang Lab focuses on the mechanisms underlying the intracellular growth of Methicillin-Resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, specifically which genes within MRSA allow it to survive the host immune response’s stressors or even use the stressors for proliferation.

Additional Interests of mine include Movies, Music, Scuba Diving, Traveling and Trying New Foods, Marine Biology, and Human Medicine.
