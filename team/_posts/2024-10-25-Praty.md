Hi, I'm Pratyusha and I'm from India. I've completed my bachelors and master’s in molecular microbiology. Currently I'm a doctoral student working in Dr. Qing Tang’s Lab. My research focuses on understanding the mechanism by which <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> thymidine dependant small colony variants (TD-SCVs) influence host immune responses, particularly in the context of cystic fibrosis lung infections. Outside the lab, I enjoy watching movies and hanging out with friends. I find peace in music-filled walks, especially on breezy days.
