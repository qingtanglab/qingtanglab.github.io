Hello, I am Jada. I am a Dallas-Fort Worth native and an undergraduate student in microbiology with a focus on immunology and genetics. My research investigates the role of macrophages in driving chronic inflammation during persistent S. aureus TD-SCV lung infections in cystic fibrosis patients. Outside of the lab, I enjoy spending time outdoors and traveling around Texas to national parks and wildlife management areas.
