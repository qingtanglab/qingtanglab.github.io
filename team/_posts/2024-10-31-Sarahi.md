Hi, my name is Sarahi Hernandez and I am an undergraduate student at UTA majoring in microbiology. I am currently a research assistant under Dr. Tang, studying the mechanisms that allow Methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> to grow intracellularly. By taking a closer look at MRSA's genetics, our work examines how they affect the host in immune system evasion and antibiotic resistance. In the future, I plan to pursue an M.D or Ph.D education to further contribute to research and medicine. In my free time, I love spending time with friends and family, driving while listening to music, reading, and tutoring schoolchildren.
