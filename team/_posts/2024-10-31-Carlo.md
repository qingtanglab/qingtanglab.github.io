Hello, my name is Carlo, I'm from Peru, and I'm currently pursuing a bachelor's in biology, seeking a specialization in the immunology field. My research within the Tang Lab centers on <i>Listeria Monocytogenes'</i> mechanism to keep homeostasis against DNA-damaging antibiotics and its effects on expressing regulator enzymes to mediate immune responses. In my free time, I enjoy reading, swimming, and learning about the wonders of the world.
